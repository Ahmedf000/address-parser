# Libpostal Overview & How It Fits

- **What Libpostal is:**  
  Libpostal is an open-source address parser that takes a full address written by a human and splits it into structured parts (like street, city, postal code). It’s trained on millions of real-world addresses from around the world.

- **Why I’m using it in my Address Parser App:**  
  I want to automatically clean and understand any address a user enters. Instead of writing many “if/else” conditions or regex, Libpostal can handle global address formats accurately.

- **What I plan to document and observe:**  
  - How accurate it is (___________)  
  - Which address types it parses well or struggles with  
  - What fallback logic I’ll add when parsing fails (____________)
