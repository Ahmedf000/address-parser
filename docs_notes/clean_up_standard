Before parsing, a clean up for a standard address output
COMMON ISSUES:
#1 remove Leading or trailing whitespace

#2 Convert alternate separators (/, ;, -, –, —) into a single comma , when they act as delimiters.
Ensure consistent comma spacing: every comma is followed by exactly one space.
Remove empty tokens created by duplicate commas (,,).

#3 Symbols cleanups
Remove parentheses although keep inside content.
as well as replace and remove # for house numbers ---> #5 to 5

#4 stip off leading assigned labels
example. address: / company:.....etc

#5 Detect missing commas or separators where possible

#a consistent output format
Street, house number, district, postal code, region, city, country.
